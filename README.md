1- Setup the MiniLibX library.

2- Create a window, image and all the necessary things in the MiniLibX.

3- Iterate through every pixel of the window.
See draw_fractal

4- For every pixel, calculate the complex number it represents and put it into the suite.
See calculate_mandelbrot for example.

5- If the suite diverges, color the pixel in white. If the suite converges, color the pixel in black
